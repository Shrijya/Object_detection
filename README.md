This project uses the RetinaNet architecture for object detection, specifically focusing on recognizing human facial expressions. It leverages deep learning techniques to detect and classify emotions from facial images, offering a robust model for emotion-based human interaction. The system can identify expressions like happiness, sadness, anger, etc., making it a valuable tool for applications in behavioral analysis, interactive systems, and more. The model is trained using labeled datasets, ensuring high accuracy in real-time recognition.
